# Integration Testing Strategy for Quiz Orchestration

## Overview

This document outlines the integration testing strategy to ensure the main quiz orchestration doesn't break during future refactoring. The tests are designed to catch issues at multiple levels: hooks, components, and full application flow.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Hook Integration Tests (`useQuizOrchestration.integration.test.ts`)

**Purpose**: Ensure all custom hooks work together correctly without UI dependencies.

**What it tests**:
- `useQuizGame` + `useQuizFeedback` + `useQuizNavigation` + `useQuizTimer` integration
- Data flow between hooks
- State consistency across hook boundaries
- Game lifecycle management (start → play → complete → restart)

**Key scenarios**:
- Game initialization and Pokemon generation
- Answer submission and feedback handling
- Round progression and score tracking
- Game completion detection
- State reset functionality

### 2. Component Integration Tests (`PokemonQuiz.integration.test.tsx`)

**Purpose**: Test the full component tree and user interactions.

**What it tests**:
- Complete UI rendering (ScoreDisplay + BattleArena + QuizAnswerSection)
- User interaction flows (clicking answers, menu interactions)
- Component state synchronization
- Visual feedback and transitions

**Note**: These tests require comprehensive mocking due to sprite services and complex dependencies.

### 3. End-to-End Tests (`quiz-flow.e2e.test.tsx`)

**Purpose**: Test the complete application from the user's perspective.

**What it tests**:
- Full quiz session from start to finish
- Browser-level interactions
- Responsive behavior
- Error handling
- State persistence during navigation

## Critical Integration Points

### 1. Quiz Orchestration Flow

```
PokemonQuiz Component
├── useQuizGame (core state)
├── useQuizFeedback (answer validation)
├── useQuizNavigation (round management)
└── useQuizTimer (timing & auto-advance)
```

**Key integration**: All hooks must receive consistent data and update in the correct sequence.

### 2. Data Flow Validation

```
User clicks answer
→ QuizAnswerSection calls handleAnswer
→ useQuizFeedback validates answer
→ useQuizTimer starts countdown
→ useQuizNavigation advances round
→ useQuizGame generates new Pokemon
→ UI updates with new state
```

**Critical checkpoints**:
- Pokemon data consistency across components
- Score updates reflect in UI immediately
- Round progression triggers new battle generation
- Timer resets properly between rounds

### 3. Component Hierarchy Integrity

```
QuizGameContainer
├── ScoreDisplay (round, score, progress)
├── QuizActiveGame
│   ├── BattleArena (Pokemon display)
│   └── QuizAnswerSection OR QuizResultFeedback
└── QuizGameOverScreen (final results)
```

**What to watch for**:
- Components receive correct props
- Conditional rendering works (game vs game-over)
- State updates propagate to all child components

## Running Integration Tests

### Quick Validation (Hook Level)
```bash
npm test src/features/quiz/hooks/useQuizOrchestration.integration.test.ts
```

### Component Level (with mocking)
```bash
npm test src/features/quiz/components/PokemonQuiz.integration.test.tsx
```

### Full Application Test
```bash
npm test src/features/quiz/e2e/quiz-flow.e2e.test.tsx
```

### All Integration Tests
```bash
npm test -- --testNamePattern="integration|Integration|e2e|E2E"
```

## Common Integration Failure Patterns

### 1. Hook Dependency Mismatches
**Symptom**: `useQuizFeedback` called with wrong parameters
**Prevention**: Hook integration tests validate parameter passing

### 2. State Update Race Conditions
**Symptom**: UI shows stale data or incorrect round/score
**Prevention**: Test state consistency after each interaction

### 3. Component Prop Interface Changes
**Symptom**: Components receive undefined props or wrong data types
**Prevention**: Component integration tests validate prop flow

### 4. Navigation Flow Breakage
**Symptom**: Game doesn't advance or gets stuck in feedback state
**Prevention**: E2E tests validate complete user journeys

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When Adding New Features

1. **Update hook integration tests** if adding new hooks or changing hook interfaces
2. **Add component integration scenarios** for new UI interactions
3. **Extend E2E tests** for new user flows

### When Refactoring

1. **Run hook tests first** - fastest feedback on core logic
2. **Check component tests** - ensure UI integration still works
3. **Validate E2E scenarios** - confirm user experience is preserved

### When Debugging Integration Issues

1. Start with hook tests to isolate logic problems
2. Move to component tests to check UI integration
3. Use E2E tests to reproduce user-reported issues

## Test Data Strategy

### Predictable Test Data
- Mock Pokemon services return consistent data
- Mock type effectiveness for known outcomes
- Control random number generation for reproducible tests

### Boundary Conditions
- Test first round, middle rounds, and final round
- Test correct answers, wrong answers, and edge cases
- Test game completion and restart scenarios

## Continuous Integration

### Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
npm run test:integration  # Run all integration tests
npm run test:unit         # Run unit tests
npm run build            # Ensure build still works
```

### CI Pipeline Validation
1. Unit tests (fast feedback)
2. Integration tests (medium feedback)
3. E2E tests (comprehensive validation)
4. Build verification

## Monitoring Integration Health

### Key Metrics to Track
- Test execution time (should remain fast)
- Test flakiness (integration tests should be stable)
- Coverage of critical user paths
- Failure patterns (common integration breakage points)

### Success Criteria
- ✅ All hook integration tests pass
- ✅ Component integration tests validate UI flow
- ✅ E2E tests cover main user journeys
- ✅ Tests run in under 30 seconds total
- ✅ No flaky tests (>95% success rate)

## Future Enhancements

### Visual Regression Testing
- Screenshot comparison for UI consistency
- Component visual diff validation

### Performance Integration Testing
- Measure render times during state updates
- Validate memory usage during long quiz sessions

### Accessibility Integration Testing
- Keyboard navigation flow validation
- Screen reader compatibility testing

**Remember**: Integration tests are your safety net during refactoring. They should give you confidence that the core user experience remains intact even as the codebase evolves.
